# Dead-With-Friends
GameDev.tv Game Jam 2022 project

Oi, this is my project for the aforementioned GameDev.tv 2022 Game Jam, taking place from May 20th to May 30th. 
I'm not entirely sure what I'm making, but I got a ghost dude I kinda like and that seems like a good enough start.

The final project can be played in browser or downloaded at https://jamblefoot.itch.io/dead-with-friends
